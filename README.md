# Perfect-Snake-Project
 
This project was a senior capstone at Westminster College Utah to try to create a perfect
snake playing algorithm.

Three methods were tried, Deep Q-Learning, A* Pathfinding, and a Hamiltonian Circuit.

Only the Hamiltonian Circuit was successful and it will be shown here along with the Deep Q-Learning files.
